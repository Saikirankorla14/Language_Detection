# Language_Detection

Project Overview
This project aims to develop a model that can automatically identify the language of a given sentence or text. Language detection is essential in many real-world applications such as multilingual chatbots, content filtering, and translation systems.
Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn for machine learning and model evaluation
- NLTK or spaCy for text preprocessing
- Dataset: Language Identification Dataset
Dataset Description
The Language Identification dataset contains text samples in various languages. Each entry includes a sentence and its corresponding language label. This dataset is commonly used for classification tasks and can be sourced from public repositories or platforms like Kaggle.
Step-by-Step Implementation
1.	1. Load the Dataset
•	   - Import the dataset and load it into a pandas DataFrame.
2.	2. Preprocess the Text
•	   - Clean and normalize the text: remove punctuation, lowercase, tokenize.
3.	3. Feature Extraction
•	   - Use TF-IDF or character-level n-grams for feature representation.
4.	4. Train the Model
•	   - Use machine learning classifiers such as Multinomial Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression.
5.	5. Evaluate the Model
•	   - Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
6.	6. Predict Language for New Text
•	   - Use the trained model to detect language in new input text.
Optional Enhancements
- Implement a REST API using Flask or FastAPI.
- Integrate with a front-end interface for live language detection.
- Use deep learning approaches like RNNs, LSTMs, or transformer-based models for better performance.
Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with text classification tasks.
- Understanding of natural language preprocessing techniques.
- Familiarity with evaluating and validating language models.
